# Cursor Rules for SODA MMQC Project

## General Guidelines
- Always follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Prefer explicit imports over wildcard imports

## Project-Specific Rules
- Follow the existing project structure and naming conventions
- Use the established configuration patterns from `soda_mmqc/config.py`
- Maintain consistency with existing test patterns in `tests/`
- When working with JSON schemas, ensure they follow the established format
- For checklist development, follow the existing directory structure in `data/checklist/`
- For checklist development, respect the structure of `data/examples` and maintain consistency with existing example organization
- Remember to install dependencies in the virtual environment and through requirements.txt

## Code Quality
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Avoid hardcoding values - use configuration files
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate logging
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Documentation
- Update README.md when adding new features
- Include examples in docstrings
- Document any new configuration options
- Keep the project structure documentation current

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't forget to activate the virtual environment (`.venv`) before running commands, experiments, or unit tests
- Don't forget to handle file paths correctly (use `pathlib` or `os.path`)
- Don't hardcode API endpoints or credentials
- Don't skip error handling for external API calls
- Don't forget to update requirements.txt when adding dependencies
- Don't create circular imports
- Don't forget to validate JSON schemas before using them
- Don't create verbose summaries using `echo` or Python `print` statements when the work already speaks for itself through code changes and test results

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Mock external API calls in tests
- Test both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Never add `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))))` to unit tests - use proper package imports instead
